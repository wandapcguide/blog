hi guys, today i wanna share my work about vb project. cause i got a homework to create a project with vb and i use vb2010, to creating my project. like the title on this artikel, i made music player

oke, the main feature is same like another music player. but i made the button by myself, and dialog from WMP is disappear. if you interest with my project click this link below <br>
<a href="https://github.com/Dante08/simple-music-player-vb10" >Visit to this repo</a> <br>
<br>
and its to much lack on this project like <br>
1. song info didnt update automaticly, you must press randomly on keyboard after you change the song and or play song firstly<br>
2. no auto next<br>
3. i add feature "if i press F2 it will change next song and if i press F1 it will change prev song" and the problem is, you cannot press the key directly to change song. you must clicking next or prev button first before you use the keyboard shortcut to change song ( what i create this? i mean to replace auto next)<br>
4. if you press pause button and want to play the song again to the current point. you must hit the play button, its meant cannot resume from current point.
<br><br>
if you like to fix one of the point which is i described above, just do it. and i will happy if you like my work, :D
